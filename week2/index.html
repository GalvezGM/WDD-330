    <h1>Week 2</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><i>JavaScript was also frequently used to create annoying pop-up adverts, as well as for 'browser sniffing' (the process of detecting which browser was being used to view a web page). It had started to gain a negative reputation.</i>This is an
            interesting statement to not especially as it correlates with last week's discussion about creating a user-friendly experience</li>
        <li><i>This described a technique of obtaining data from a server in the background and updating only the relevant parts of the web page without the need for a full page reload, enabling users to continue interacting with the rest of the 
            page. This created a more seamless experience for users and was used extensively in many Web 2.0 applications. As a result, professional programmers started to take more notice of JavaScript, and it began to be seen as a powerful and flexible 
            programming language, capable of producing high-quality web applications.</i> Intersting to note as I've seen this in most job applications.</li>
        <li><i>Syntactic sugar allows an existing piece of code to be written in a nicer and more succinct way.</i></li>
        <li>The main difference was that variables declared using let and const have block scope, which is discussed in more detail below. They also prevent you from overwriting any built-in methods by assignment, which is generally frowned upon, whereas using var doesn't.</li>
        <li>Objects can also have methods. Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.</li>
        <li>Avoid String, Number, and Boolean objects. They complicate your code and slow down execution speed.</li>
        <li><i>The parameters come before the arrow and the main body of the function comes after. Arrow functions are always anonymous, so if you want to refer to them, you must assign them to a variable.</i> Never used this but was observed several times in codepen.</li>   
    </ul>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I noticed from my reading that there are methods I haven't used yet. Does it matter when it comes in a work environment what to use?</li>
        </ul>
