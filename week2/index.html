    <h1>Week 2</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><i>JavaScript was also frequently used to create annoying pop-up adverts, as well as for 'browser sniffing' (the process of detecting which browser was being used to view a web page). It had started to gain a negative reputation.</i>This is an
            interesting statement to not especially as it correlates with last week's discussion about creating a user-friendly experience</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>These questions are for the course. Would there be tutoring or a TA for the following weeks?</li>
        <li>Would there be Zoom sessions within the week?</li>
        <li>Would stringify and JSON.parse be useful for validation purposes?</li>
    </ul>
