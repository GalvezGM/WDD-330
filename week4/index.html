    <h1>Week 4</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically. Note that submitting a form using this method won’t trigger the form submit event that's covered in the next section.</li>
        <li>The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML.</li>
        <li>Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data that’s been entered. So think very carefully before using one in a form.</li>
        <li>The autofocus attribute give focus to this element when a page loads.</li>
        <li>Validation can occur on the client side using JavaScript, and on the server side. It is advisable to use both client-side and server-side validation. JavaScript should not be relied upon to validate any data before it’s saved to a database. This is because it’s possible for a user to modify the JavaScript code and bypass the validation rules. It's also very easy to bypass the front-end completely and send arbitrary data to the application's backend.</li>
        <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods. This approach has the benefit of keeping related pieces of code encapsulated in objects that maintain state throughout the life of the program. The objects can also be reused or easily modified, as required. </li>
        <li>Encapsulation:  involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to knowhowit’s done.

</li>
        <li>Polymorphism:  various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</li>
        <li>Inheritance: take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</li>
        <li>A golden rule to remember is:Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype.</li>
        <li></li>
