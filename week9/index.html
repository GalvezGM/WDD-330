    <h1>Week 9</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Any variables that are created in the global scope are actually properties of this object, and any functions are methods of it. In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web page.</li>
        <li>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.</li>
        <li>The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box.</li>
        <li>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. </li>
        <li>The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program.</li>
        <li>The Navigator object contains information about the browser being used. Its userAgent property will return information about the browser and operating system being used. </li>
        <li>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session. Avoid confusing this with the new HTML5 History API.</li>
        <li>The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on.</li>
        <li>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer.</li>
        <li>Cookies can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing experience, storing user preferences, keeping track of user choices (such as a shopping cart), authentication and tracking users.</li>
        <li>he window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to window.setTimeout() , except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds.</li>
        <li>The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page. </li>
        <li>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. </li>
        <li>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device.</li>
        <li>Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript. </li>
        <li>The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notifications. This is usually a popup in the corner of the screen, but it changes depending on the operating system. </li>
        <li>Before HTML5, it was notoriously difficult to display audio and video in browsers, and plugins such as Flash often had to be used.</li>
        <li>The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a web page in real time using JavaScript. A canvas element is a rectangular element on the web page.</li>
        </ul>
