    <h1>Week 5</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</li>
        <li>Stack trace is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.</li>
        <li>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning. </li>
        <li>For this reason, a ninja programmer should ensure that the code they write fails loudly in development so any errors can be identified and fixed quickly. In production, a ninja programmer should try to make the code fail gracefully (although not completely silently ― we still need to know there’s an error), so the user experience is not affected, if possible. This is achieved by making sure exceptions are caught and dealt with, and code is tested rigorously.</li>
        <li>Strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features</li>
        <li>Limiting tools designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented.</li>
        <li>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them.</li>
        <li>Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.
            A test can simply be a function that tests a piece of code runs as it should. </li>
        <li>Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code.</li>Write tests (that initially fail)
        <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
        <li>Refactor the code</li>
        <li>Test refactored code</li>
        <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
        <li>Jest is a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently. It makes it easy to create and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions.</li>
