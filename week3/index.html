    <h1>Week 3</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>An object literal is an object that is created directly in the language by wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces {} . Object literals are a distinguishing feature of the JavaScript language, as they allow objects to be created quickly without the need for defining a class. They also provide a useful way of organizing your code without polluting the global namespace.</li>
        <li>The keyword this refers to the object that it is within. It can be used inside methods to gain access to the objectâ€™s properties.</li>
        <li>JSON is a string representation of the object literal notation that we have just seen. There are, however, a couple of key differences:
            Property names must be double-quoted
            Permitted values are double-quoted strings, numbers, true, false, null, arrays and objects
            Functions are not permitted values</li>
        <li>Node lists are array-like objects, but they are not arrays. You can access each item using index notation. For example, document.images[0] will return the first image in the node list of all the images in the document.</li>
        </ul>
