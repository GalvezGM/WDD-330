    <h1>Week 8</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. While some of these effects were possible using previously existing CSS features (such as translating with relative and absolute positioning), CSS3 gives you unprecedented control over many more aspects of the element’s appearance.</li>
        <li>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down.</li>
        <li>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically.</li>
        <li>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. </li>
        <li>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. </li>
        <li>Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations. </li>
        <li>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state. </li>
        <li>TThe transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail.  </li>
        <li>Finally, by using the transition-delay property, it’s possible to introduce a delay before the transition begins.</li>
        <li>CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.</li>
        <li>A keyframe is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition. </li>
        <li>Canvas allows for pixel manipulation, as we saw when we turned our video from color to black and white.</li>
        <li>Drag and Drop allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page.</li>
        <li>Note that draggable isnota Boolean attribute, so you have to explicitly set it to true .</li>
        <li>DataTransfer objects are one type of object outlined in the Drag and Drop API. These objects allow us to set and get data about the elements that are being dragged</li>
    </ul>
